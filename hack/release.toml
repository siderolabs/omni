title = "Allow `talosctl wipe disk` Command"
description = """\
`talosctl wipe disk` can now be used with Omni managed nodes.
Omni will impersonate `os:admin` role for it if the user has write access to the cluster.

[notes.fusion-auth]
title = "Support Fusion Auth"
description = """\
Fusion Auth provider is now supported via SAML.
Additional parameter `--auth-saml-name-id-format` must be set to `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress`.
"""

[notes.providers]
title = "Infra Providers Request ID"
description = """\
Infra providers can now be configured to encode `MachineRequest` ID into the join token.
With that enabled setting the machine UUID in the `MachineRequestStatus` is no longer required in the provider:
Omni will automatically map the `MachineRequest` ID to the node UUID and will populate the field in the status.

This change is useful in the infra providers where it's impossible to get the created machine UUID.
