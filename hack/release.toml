  [notes.exposed-services]
    title = "Exposed Services DNS Name"
    description = """\
Exposed services now use new naming schema, so it shouldn't be affected by slow DNS updates.

The domain name patter is now: `<hash>-<account>.proxy-us.siderolabs.io`.
"""

  [notes.break-glass]
    title = "Break-Glass Configs"
    description = """\
Omni now allows getting raw Talos and Kubernetes configs that can allow bypassing Omni when
accessing the cluster.

It has a couple of limitations:

- It is available only if is enabled for the account.
- Only `os:operator` role Talosconfig level is available.
- The cluster will be marked as tainted for the time being, which doesn't affect anything, but is
the signal that Omni no longer fully controls secrets rotation.

  [notes.machine-logs]
    title = "Machine Logs"
    description = """\
Machine logs are now stored using new persitent circular buffer library, which has better write efficiency.
"""

  [notes.kubeconfig]
    title = "Kubeconfig Authcode-Keyboard"
    description = """\
It is now possible to generate `kubeconfig` with `--grant-type=authcode-keyboard` and Omni
supports that mode.
This mode will print a URL and ask for a one time code instead of starting a local HTTP server on port `8000`.
Clicking the URL will open the same Omni page as usual, but will present you the one time code instead of doing redirect.

This mode is useful for remote machine `kubectl` execution and removes the need to set up ssh port-forwarding.
"""

  [notes.pending-updates]
    title = "Pending Updates"
    description = """\
Omni UI now shows pending config changes which are not applied due to locked machines in the cluster.
