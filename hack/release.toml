    description = """\
Omni now supports [bare metal infra provider](https://github.com/siderolabs/omni-infra-provider-bare-metal/).

This provider operates as a standalone service that can be deployed within a bare-metal datacenter network.
It manages machines via IPMI, supports PXE-based booting, and enables machine resets without relying on the Talos API.

Its functionality closely resembles that of Sidero Metal.

For detailed setup instructions, refer to the [documentation](https://omni.siderolabs.com/tutorials/setting-up-the-bare-metal-infrastructure-provider)..

    description = """\
The Machines page now categorizes machines based on how they were added to the account:

- Manual: Machines manually added by installing Talos with siderolink parameters.
- Provisioned: Machines created by infrastructure providers (e.g., KubeVirt).
- PXE-Booted: Machines discovered and accepted from the bare-metal infrastructure provider.
- Pending: Machines discovered but not yet accepted from the bare-metal infrastructure provider.
